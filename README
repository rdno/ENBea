ENBea (Episode Name Beautifier)


It's a simple program that renames TV episode files using IMDb API
(http://imdbapi.poromenos.org/). It parses filenames for finding show
names and episode numbers. So mostly after you add your files to the
list, it downloads episode list for shows and write new filenames
using filemask. If show name can't be found. You need to set yourself.

Available file masks strings:
	  %show -> Show Name
	  %season -> season
	  %Season -> two digit season (for shows have more than 9 seasons
	  	     ex: 01
	  %episode -> two digit episode number
	  %name -> episode name

It's written in PyQt (Python 2.7, PyQt 4.8.1).
To run enbea first you need to compile ui files using:
   $ python setup.py compileui
After you done that you can start the program:
   $ python enbea.py
